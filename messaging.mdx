# Messaging

Groupbox provides a powerful way for teams to stay connected and collaborate in real time. Communication happens in **channels** or through **direct messages**.

## Channels

Channels are shared spaces where teams can chat and collaborate.

1. Open the **space dropdown** (requires privileges).
